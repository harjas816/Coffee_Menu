# Coffee Menu
Project for Flatiron School Phase 1

## Project Description
In this project you can find a few different coffees from around the world, learn what type of coffee beans that they use, and a fun fact about them.

## How to Use this Project
To be able to access the objects in the array, you should open the JSON server.

 **json-server --watch db.json**

When you open the index.html, you should be able to see a list of coffees to the left-hand side. If you click on one of the coffees in the list, the information will be displayed in the center of the page. To find out a fun/interesting fact about the coffee mouseover the image and the fun fact will pop up at the bottom of the page. 

You can also add a new coffee by entering new coffee information into the form at the bottom left of the page. New coffee information should contain - name of coffee, an image of the coffee you wish see, what type of coffee bean it uses, the country it orginates from, and a fun fact about the coffee that you would like people to know about.
